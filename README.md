Capital Greek 

The goal for this website is to get users to find the tools and resources they need to help them focus on making the right financial decison.

I added a social feature where other users can post insights or tips for the financial community.

The test cases are located inside the root directory of my project inside  "__tests__" folder

I added a news api so users can be updated on what's going on in the economy.

I used react and node js to build this project
